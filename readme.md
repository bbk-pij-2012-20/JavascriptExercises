Javascript exercises
--

A bunch of Javascript code that I have written to help me learn Javascript. Initially inspired by listening to Venkat Subramaniam's talk 'Rediscovering Javascript' (on youtube).

The code is written in html files so that the code can be run in a web browser. (The console.log() outputs are in the browser's console).

Venkat's talk covered some aspects of the basics of Javascript, functions, object creation, class creation and prototypal inheritance.

Closures, call backs and event driven were not mentioned. The code I wrote for these topics were informed by talks by .. (again youtube).
