Javascript exercises
--

This repo includes a bunch of Javascript that I have written to help me learn Javascript. Initially inspired by listening to Venkat Subramaniam's talk 'Rediscovering Javascript' (on youtube).

In order to run the code using a browser's Javascript engine, the javascript is embedded in html files. The code itself is duplicated within html tags so that it is immediately visible from the browser.

Venkat's talk covered some aspects of the basics of Javascript, as well as functions, object creation, class creation and prototypal inheritance.
<ul>
<b><li>basics</li></b>

<li>exercise#1: semi-colons</li>
<li>exercise#2: local & global variables</li>
<li>exercise#3: lexical scoping</li>
<li>exercise#4: type coercion</li>
<li>exercise#5: object creation</li>
<li>exercise#6: class creation</li>

<b><li>functions</li></b>

<li>exercise#1: hoisting</li>
<li>exercise#2: arguments & parameters</li>
<li>exercise#3: context objects, apply() and call()</li>
<li>exercise#4: higher order functions</li>
<li>exercise#5: closures</li>

<b><li>prototypal_inheritance</li></b>
<li>exercise#1: prototypes</li>
<li>exercise#2: examining properties</li>
</ul>

Closures, call backs and event driven were not mentioned. The code I wrote for these topics were informed by talks by .. (again youtube).
