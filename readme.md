Javascript exercises
--

This repo includes a bunch of Javascript that I have written to help me learn Javascript. Initially inspired by listening to Venkat Subramaniam's talk 'Rediscovering Javascript' (on youtube).

In order to run the code using a browser's Javascript engine, the javascript is embedded in html files. The code is duplicate in html so that it is also immediately visible from the browser. 

Venkat's talk covered some aspects of the basics of Javascript, functions, object creation, class creation and prototypal inheritance.

Closures, call backs and event driven were not mentioned. The code I wrote for these topics were informed by talks by .. (again youtube).
