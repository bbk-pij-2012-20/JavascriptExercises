Javascript exercises
--

A set of exercises intended to help me learn Javascript. Inspired by listening to Venkat Subramaniam's talk 'Rediscovering Javascript' (on youtube).

His talk covered some aspects of the basics of Javascript, functions, object creation, class creation and prototypal inheritance.

Closures, call backs and event driven were not mentioned. The code I wrote for these topics were informed by talks by .. (again youtube).
