Javascript exercises
--

This repo includes a bunch of Javascript that I have written to help me learn Javascript. Initially inspired by listening to Venkat Subramaniam's talk 'Rediscovering Javascript' (on youtube).

The code is written in html and the javascript is embedded in an html files so that the code is immediately visible when run in a web browser. (Also done this way to give me a little html practice).

Venkat's talk covered some aspects of the basics of Javascript, functions, object creation, class creation and prototypal inheritance.

Closures, call backs and event driven were not mentioned. The code I wrote for these topics were informed by talks by .. (again youtube).
