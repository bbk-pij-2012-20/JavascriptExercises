Semi colons
--
Javascript will add in missing semi colons at the end of a statement but will add a semi-colon prematurely if the statement is broken up and continued on a new line and if it constitutes a complete statement by itself.

Local and gloal variables
--
A variable that is declared inside a method will be local if it is preceded by a var, but global if it is declared without a var.

Type coercion
--
Refers to implicit data type conversion which is done when using double equals, ==

The use of === does not allow coercion, instead comparing the data types and values as they are.
