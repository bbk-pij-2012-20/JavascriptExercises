Basics of Javascript:
--

<h3>Semi-colons:</h3>

Javascript will add in missing semi-colons at the end of a statement but will add a semi-colon prematurely if the statement is broken up and continued on the next line and if the latter part of the statement (on the next line) constitutes a complete statement by itself.

<h3>Local and global variables:</h3>

A variable that is declared inside a method will be local if it is preceded by a var, but global if it is declared without a var.

<h3>Type coercion:</h3>

Refers to implicit data type conversion which is done when using double equals, ==

The use of === does not allow coercion, instead comparing the data types and values as they are.

<h3>Dynamically-typed:</h3>

Refers to when type-checking is performed. Dynamically-typed (as opposed to statically-typed) does the type checking at run time.

<h3>Weakly-typed:</h3>

Is a poorly-defined description of how strict the language is with allowing type conversions.

<h3>Object creation:</h3>

<h3>Class creation:</h3>

<h3>Examining properties:</h3>
