Judging by the demo video: (http://oneis-recruitment.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/stories-web-app.mp4)

One might consider the view of stories to be modelled by a tree data structure wherein the
starting story page is defined by the central story segment - the parent node or root -
and that it has four child nodes. Each child node also has four child nodes. Such a
structure could continue indefinitely.

I will assign each of the child nodes to west, north, east and south, making it clear
its position in the grid format, relative to the central position of the parent node.
